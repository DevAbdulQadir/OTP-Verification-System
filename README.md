# OTP-Verification-System

The sole purpose of an OTP is to verify the identity of a user by sending a unique password.

We can easily create an application for the task of OTP verification using Python by following the steps mentioned below:
1-First, create a 6-digit random number and store the number in a variable
2-Then we need to write a program to send emails
3-When sending email, we need to use OTP as a message
4-Finally, we need to request two user inputs; first for the userâ€™s email and then for the OTP that the user has received.

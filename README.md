# OTP-Verification-System

The sole purpose of an OTP is to verify the identity of a user by sending a unique password.

We can easily create an application for the task of OTP verification using Python by following the steps mentioned below:  
1-First, create a 6-digit random number and store the number in a variable  
2-Then we need to write a program to send emails  
3-When sending email, we need to use OTP as a message  
4-Finally, we need to request two user inputs; first for the userâ€™s email and then for the OTP that the user has received.  


Get_OTP() will create a 6 digits code and return its value.  
GetEmail() will take the email from user and check if user is putting right format of email.  
Check_OTP() will verify the OTP. It allows 3 attemps in case user puts the wrong OTP.
